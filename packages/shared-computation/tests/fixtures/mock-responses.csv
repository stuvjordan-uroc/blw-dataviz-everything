# Mock response data for testing
# 
# FORMAT: respondent_id,weight,party,age_group,approval,anger
# 
# VALUE TYPES:
# - Numeric value (e.g., 0, 1, 1.5): Creates ResponseData element with that value
# - Empty or "null": Creates ResponseData element with response=null (null response)
# - "MISSING" (case-insensitive): Omits ResponseData element entirely (missing entry)
# 
# QUESTION VALUES:
# party: 0=Democrat, 1=Republican
# age_group: 0=18-34, 1=35-54, 2=55+
# approval: 0=Strongly Approve, 1=Somewhat Approve, 2=Somewhat Disapprove, 3=Strongly Disapprove
# anger: 0=none, 1=irritated, 2=hot, 3=aflame
# 
# TESTING TWO TYPES OF MISSING DATA:
# 1. Null response: Element exists with response=null (e.g., ",,0" creates party element with null)
# 2. Missing entry: No element created at all (e.g., "MISSING" omits element entirely)
