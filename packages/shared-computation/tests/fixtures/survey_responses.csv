# Survey responses fixture for shared-computation SegmentViz tests
#
# Values are encoded as 0-based indices (SegmentViz expects numeric codes):
#   Mood: 0=very sad, 1=sad, 2=happy, 3=very happy
#   Gender: 0=male, 1=female
#   Height: 0=short, 1=tall
#
# Overall totals (20 complete responses; 6 responses contain NULL or SKIPPED and are excluded from proportions):
#   Mood code 0 (very sad): 2 (10% of complete responses)
#   Mood code 1 (sad):      4 (20% of complete responses)
#   Mood code 2 (happy):    8 (40% of complete responses)
#   Mood code 3 (very happy): 6 (30% of complete responses)
#
# NOTE: `SegmentViz` and the tests compute proportions excluding any respondent that has `NULL` or `SKIPPED` for any question. The CSV below contains 26 total rows, 6 of which are incomplete and should be ignored when computing proportions.
#
# Grouping by gender+height (each COMPLETE group has 5 responses):
#   gender=0,height=0  (male,short)  (5 complete): mood counts -> 0:1 (20%), 1:1 (20%), 2:2 (40%), 3:1 (20%)
#   gender=0,height=1  (male,tall)   (5 complete): mood counts -> 0:0 (0%),  1:1 (20%), 2:3 (60%), 3:1 (20%)
#   gender=1,height=0  (female,short)(5 complete): mood counts -> 0:1 (20%), 1:1 (20%), 2:2 (40%), 3:1 (20%)
#   gender=1,height=1  (female,tall) (5 complete): mood counts -> 0:0 (0%),  1:1 (20%), 2:1 (20%), 3:3 (60%)
#
# Grouping by height only (10 complete each):
#  height=0 (short): mood counts -> 0:2 (20%), 1:2 (20%), 2:4 (40%), 3:2 (20%)
#  height=1 (tall):  mood counts -> 0:0 (0%), 1:2 (20%), 2:4 (40%), 3:4 (40%)
#
# Grouping by gender only (10 complete each):
#  gender=0 (male):   mood counts -> 0:1 (10%), 1:2 (20%), 2:5 (50%), 3:2 (20%)
#  gender=1 (female): mood counts -> 0:1 (10%), 1:2 (20%), 2:3 (30%), 3:4 (40%)
